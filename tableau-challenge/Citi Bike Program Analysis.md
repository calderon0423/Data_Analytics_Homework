# New York Citi Bike Program

### Subscriber Behavioral Differences by Gender 

* Time Period Analyzed: July - August 2013

Behavioral differences were observed between female and male Citi Bike subscribers. 

Although both genders followed a similar pattern in ride start time there were slight differences. The two most popular start times for both male and female subscribers were 5 pm and 6 pm however, 8 am was the third most popular time for male subscribers while 7 pm for women subscribers. One may conclude that women start and end their days later than men. 

Both gender's average trip length was longer during the weekend than the weekday. This may be due to utilization of the bike program for leisure during the weekend and for work transportation during the weekdays. Average trip length for women was longer throughout the week. 

In terms of age, majority of male and female subscribers are in their mid 20s to mid 30s. Most male subscribers are age 30 and 28. Male subscriber count decreases after age 30. Most female subscribers are age 31 and 28 and subcription decreases after age 31. Women have a small peak at 36 but not as prominent as the two observed in men at age 43 and 53. 


### Behavioral Differences by User Type

Clear behavioral differences were also observed between the two user groups; customers and subscribers. 

In the two-month period analyzed, customer count remained relatively flat. In contrast, subscriber count increased the first month then plateaued. Customer count increased by 6.4% while subscriber count increased by 22%. A hypothesis for the difference in growth rates between the two user groups is repeat usage. Subscribers are expected to continue to use the Citi Bike program month after month if utilizing for work transportation. This continued usage would increase the user count at a higher rate than customers. Customers may be primarily tourist or one-time users thus maintaining the customer count relatively flat month after month. 

Start time also varied by user type. Subscribers have two distinct start-time peaks, 8 am and 5-6pm. On the other hand, customer start their trips between 10 am and 7 pm. A hypothesis is usage occasion. Based on the data, I suspect Customers are tourist or one-time users while Subscribers utilize the bikes to commute to and from work. This can be concluded based on the start times during work commute hours and a small uptick during lunch time.
